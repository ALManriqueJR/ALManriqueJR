ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ALManriqueJR

At my 1st college, I did a research supported by CNPq scholarship, participating in symposiums and translating article into English, got an award for Best Paper in Session of Health, Biological and Agricultural Sciences with a modest [paper](http://bt.fatecsp.br/media/bulletins/bt48v2.pdf) publication.

**Currently migrating to the IT area, already worked in the Infrastructure field, and in the ongoing phase as an Assistant Instructor Researcher in a partnership between the college and Huawei Brazil, with the intervention of UNESP Foundation for Development (FUNDUNESP).**
